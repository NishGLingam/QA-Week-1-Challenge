# QA-Week-1-Challenge

What was the challenge?

The challenge was to break down the project of building a website for a National Cinema Company into epics and user stories with time estimates, acceptance criteria and definitions of done included.

How I expected the challenge to go

Having never written user stories before, I did expect to intiially struggle, especially with how to structure my epics and user stories. I expected the challenge to get easier as I wrote my inital few user stories and got a better grip of how to structure them and what to include in them.

What went well?

I feel that the challenge reinforced my understanding of user stories by allowing me to put what I had learnt earlier this week into real examples. By writing my own epics and user stories I was able to better understand how to break down a project into more manageable pieces. I also think that the learning towards the end of the week on databases and queries also helped me with understanding how much work would be involved in some of the user stories.

What didn't go as planned?

I found it difficult to come up with user stories from the Admin's perspective and to gauge the expectations of the admin suite. I also found it difficult to come up with time estimates on the different user stories as I do not yet have a clear understanding of the work involved in implementing and testing these features and the size of the development team we had at hand. Also some work over two user stories may overlap which made it harder to gauge how much time tasks would take.

Possible improvements for future challenges.

An example Epic included in the README.md of the tasks so you can start the task with a better understanding of how to structure your epics, user stories and acceptance criterias.
